          . My love for coding drives me to create functional, minimalistic
          websites that solve real-world problems. I&apos;m dedicated to

          My journey into web development began with a simple goal: build a tool
          to gain an advantage in a game I loved. But what started as a
          curiosity quickly evolved into a passion for solving complex problems
          through code. The challenge of tackling a problem, finding a solution,
          and seeing it come to life on the web truly captivates me.
